✴️ Design Philosophy: Precision and Purpose

    Minimal by default. Powerful by design.

Revenant tools are engineered to be unobtrusive, operating silently until explicitly invoked, at which point they deliver instantaneous and precise action. Each project is deliberately modular, fully scriptable, and built with the discerning power user in mind. We eliminate clutter, avoid persistent daemons, and reject unnecessary abstractions to provide a streamlined and efficient experience.
